# OperatingSystem_TaskScheduler

## BY ARIEL GLIKMAN


This program simulates an OS scheduler by implementing two policies: Shortest Job First (SJF) and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ). 
To run the program on the command line enter 'make' which will compile the program and output an executable called.
Decide between running the program with 1,2,4, or 8 CPUS and the policy: 'sjf' or 'mlfq' (note that they should be entered in lowercase). Once you have made a decision run the program by entering the following on the command line:
'./a3 <number of cpus> <policy>'.
